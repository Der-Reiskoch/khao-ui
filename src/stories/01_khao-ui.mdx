## About the Name

"Khao" (ข้าว) is the Thai name for rice. Just as rice is the basis of many Asian dishes, this component library will be the new basis for my blogs [Der Reiskoch](https://www.der-reiskoch.de/), [ahaan-thai.de](https://www.ahaan-thai.de/) and other projects.

## Styling

The UI Components are styled with css-custom-properties that are provided by the [Khao Malet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@der-reiskoch/khao-malet) design system.
You can easyily style them by overwritng the css-custom-properties.

## Usage

Example usage of the button component

```html
<khao-button
  label="Secondary Button"
  priority="secondary"
  href="/go-somewhere"
></khao-button>
```
