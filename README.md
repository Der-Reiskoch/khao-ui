# Khao UI

This is a Component Library based on Svelte Components that are provided as web-components.

## About the Name

"Khao" (ข้าว) is the Thai name for rice. Just as rice is the basis of many Asian dishes, this component library will be the new basis for my blogs [Der Reiskoch](https://www.der-reiskoch.de/), [ahaan-thai.de](https://www.ahaan-thai.de/) and other projects.
