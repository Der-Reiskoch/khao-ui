## Build

There are two types of builds available for the Components

### Library

To create a library that includes all components and the css with fonts from [Khao Malet](https://github.com/Der-Reiskoch/khao-malet) design system perform

```bash
npm run build:lib
```

(this option is also used for building nnp packages)

### Splitted Code

To create a single JS File for every component and and index.js file (without any CSS and fonts!) perform

```bash
npm run build:split
```

## About the Name

"Khao" (ข้าว) is the Thai name for rice. Just as rice is the basis of many Asian dishes, this component library will be the new basis for my blogs [Der Reiskoch](https://www.der-reiskoch.de/), [ahaan-thai.de](https://www.ahaan-thai.de/) and other projects.
